# Data Engineering Capstone Project

## Executive Summary

The goal of this project to design a data mart, develop an ETL Pipeline and load the data into data mart for reporitng and analytics purposes using Apache Spark and Amazon s3.

## DataSets:

### I94 Immigration Data: 

This data comes from the US National Tourism and Trade Office. A data dictionary is included in the workspace. (https://travel.trade.gov/research/reports/i94/historical/2016.html) - This is where the data comes from. There's a sample file so you can take a look at the data in csv format before reading it all in. You do not have to use the entire dataset, just use what you need to accomplish the goal you set at the beginning of the project.

### U.S. City Demographic Data: 

This data comes from OpenSoft. You can read more about it here - https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-cities-demographics/export/.

### Airport Code Table: 

This is a simple table of airport codes and corresponding cities. It comes from here - https://datahub.io/core/airport-codes#data.

## Methodology
